# Mobile-Architect-Programming

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal for this project is to develop a function mobile app that that includes UI design and a functioning database. This app is designed to allow users to input their daily body weights to be stored in a database table. Users can also input a target weight and be notified when that target is reached. This app can help users by giving them a way to track their weight loss or gain in order to visualize and record their progress. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Their are two main screens for this weight tracking app, a log in/ create account screen and a screen that displays their past weigh ins. on the daily weight table screen, there are buttons to add a daily weigh in and to deltete a weigh in. The UI design is simple and straight forward which allows users to quickly understand the different functions.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
When devolping code for my app, I first started with designing the UI. Once I had the different screens and elements, I was able to code modularly and break up the differrent aspects of the app using the MVC model. This approach can be applied to most coding projects in the future because being able to break up different sections in code is a good way to stay organized and ensure each piece of code works by itself and as a whole.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To test my code, I used the Android Emulator inside Android Studio. I tested both positive and negative use cases for the different functions of my app. I also examined the Database to ensure it was being properly populated with data. This process is crucial when devoloping an application because it ensures functional code that is free of errors.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
My biggest challenge when devloping this app was getting my UI to properly interface with the backend code, mainly when trying to populate screens with data from the database. Overcoming this challenge required the implementation of differnt classes and methods to control different aspects of the UI and the data. 

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The component of my app that demonstrates my skill would have to be the backened java classes that control how the UI operates. This was particularly successful because I was able to create functioning code that follows best coding practices.
